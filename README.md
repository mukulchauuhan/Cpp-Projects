## 1. Number Guessing Game

A simple CLI-based number guessing game that utilizes **pseudo-random number generation**.

### Key Concepts Learned:
- **PRNG (Pseudo Random Number Generator)** fundamentals.
- Utilized `srand()` and `rand()` functions for number generation.
- Seeding the generator using **C++ STL** to enhance randomness.
- Understanding how PRNGs work under the hood.

## 2. Simple Calculator

A basic calculator program that performs arithmetic operations using user inputs.

### Key Concepts Learned:
- Use of **`switch` statement** to handle multiple operations.
- **User input** and basic data validation.
- Introduction to **STL Vectors** and usage of `.push_back()` method:
  - Adds elements dynamically at the end of the vector container.

## 3. Student Grading System

A program that stores student data and calculates grades based on their scores.

### Key Concepts Learned:
- **Structures** in C++ and their role in storing different datatypes together.
- **Dynamic arrays** for handling variable numbers of students.
- Code **modularity** by separating tasks into multiple reusable functions.
- Efficiency improvements by designing clean and maintainable logic.

## ðŸ’» How to Compile & Run (For All Projects)

### ðŸ”§ Unix/Linux/macOS:
```bash
g++ -o your_program your_program_name.cpp
./your_program
```

### ðŸ–¥ Windows:
```bash
g++ -o your_program.exe your_program_name.cpp
your_program.exe
```

> Ensure **GCC** or any compatible **C++ compiler** is installed on your system.
